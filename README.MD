# A Simple User Login and Registration Program

Here I have created a very simple program that allows a user to register a username and password and use those credentials to then log in. The password is hashed upon registration and when the user logs in the program compares the password that is entered at login with the hashed password by hashing it again and making sure that they are the same.

This program is to not be used in any production enviroment as it is not safe nor secure. It was only created to help further my understanding and learning of Python as a beginner.
